## Contact Info

One challenge faced by many in the Bitcoin community is the duplication of conversations across numerous channels. 

To streamline communication and ensure context, we've made an intentional decision to adopt three specific 
communication methods, each with a distinct purpose. This approach allows us to effectively address relevant 
queries and filter out those that are out of context.

- **Lightning Network Dev Communication**: This takes place on [Zulip](https://lampo-dev.zulipchat.com/). Invitations are required for participation.
 If you're interested in joining, consider contributing to the project first. After contributing, request an invitation by sending an
  [email](mailto:vincenzopalazzo@member.fsf.org). It's possible that a maintainer of Lampo (or one of its subsystems) might also extend
   an invitation to you.

- **Community Support**: For general questions or support, please visit our [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/lampoln/). Should 
our community grow significantly, we'll consider transitioning to a self-hosted forum. However, for the time being, Reddit suits our needs perfectly.

- **Technical Questions and Feature Requests**: Please direct these to our GitHub discussions (not the issues section). Once a feature
request is accepted, the maintainer will transfer the discussion to an issue for more detailed tracking and updates.
