## Command Line Interface

After you install the deamon and the cli binary as decrived in the [install docs](TODO),
you need to run the node with the following Command

```bash
lampod-cli --config /home/vincent/.lampo/testnet --client nakamoto
```

Then you can interact with the deamon through the unix socker and you can 
expolore the API in this page.
